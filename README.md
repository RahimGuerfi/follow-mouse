## 💡 Idea

Inspiration: [https://www.volumental.com/employees](https://volumental.com/employees)

While applying for developer positions online, I came across this company's website and was impressed by the way they implemented their employee page.

I made the decision to implement this feature by myself because I saw it as a challenge to test my skills and improve them.
